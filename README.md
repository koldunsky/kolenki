KOLENKI is a PWA that allows you to make a list of words you want to learn and revise it repeatedly.

A concept of the app is a maximum simplicity, no advertisement, no registration, no premium accounts.
There is no pre-collected database with words, you decide what to add, 
when to practice and when to delete words from the list.

This is not a platform, this is a simple and useful tool for you.

## Fast start
```
yarn install
yarn run serve
```

- [x] Sortable list
